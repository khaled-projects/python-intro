   Rumor has it that a dragon and a troll are somewhere around here, and have been terrifying the nearby village.
   In front of you is a house.
   To your right is a dark cave.
   In your hands you hold your trusty (but not very effective) dagger and bow.

2. **Choosing a Path:**
   - Enter 1 to knock on the door of the house.
   - Enter 2 to peer into the cave.
   What would you like to do?
   (Please enter 1 or 2.)

   It turns out to be only a very small cave.
   Your eye catches a glint of metal behind a rock.
   You have found a sword!
   Enter '1' to replace your current weapon with the new one, '2' to keep your current weapons.

4. **Fighting Enemies:**
   You approach the door of the house.
   You are about to knock when the door opens and out steps a dragon and a troll.
   Eep! This is the dragon's and troll's house!
   The dragon attacks you with a magic staff!
   The troll attacks you with an axe!
   You face the dragon and troll with your sword and bow.
   Enter '1' to attack one enemy with each arm, '2' to focus on one enemy with both arms.

5. **Scoring:**
